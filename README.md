# Public_IP_Checker
This is a bash script for a public IP checker. 

The script requires a working e-mail service to run propperly. 
After the e-mail service / daemon is configured on the machine, the mailer.config is the place where you can add all the details for the script to run

Things to improve:
1) introduce the option for a monthly report 
2) make the database optional
3) your suggestions :P
